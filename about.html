    <p>My name is Will Brown and I’m a mechanical engineer who specializes in working with medical device companies and doing 
        early stage R&D. I have extensive experience working with startups of all sizes, from directly working with a founder 
        that has a germ of an idea, to working as a single contributor as part of a much larger team. I also firmly believe that 
        community is at the heart of what we do as small companies. So if I can’t help you, I’d love to try to put you in contact 
        with someone I think could!
