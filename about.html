    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Will Brown and I’m a mechanical engineer who specializes in working with medical device companies and doing 
        early stage R&D. I have extensive experience working with startups of all sizes, from directly working with a founder 
        that has a germ of an idea, to working as a single contributor as part of a much larger team. I also firmly believe that 
        community is at the heart of what we do as small companies. So if I can’t help you, I’d love to try to put you in contact 
        with someone I think could!
    </p>

    <h3>The Name</h3>

    The name AstroTino is a mash up of things I love.

            <b>Astro</b> - space! I love space, always have and probably always will. Working with
            NASA on a few of my projects has been a dream come true and with any luck some of my work will be flying on the ISS sometime in the future,
            fingers crossed!

            <b>Ti</b> - Tico is my wonderful cat, he's also the yellow figure in our logo and makes sure I take ample breaks during the day to play with him.

            <b>No</b> - Nova is my angel of a dog. She is the sweetest dog that simply wants to curl up in your lap all day and go whereever you go, especially if there will be
            belly rubs and snacks. In fact she's in my lap curled up as I write this.

        something fun!
