## The Cult of Done

I make no promises about the output of this blog section. That being said, I thought it was appropriate to include a post about this video that actually got this website made. I think it can serve as a good kickstart for anyone in a creativity or productivity rut. It can’t be applied to all situations directly, but I think it has a way of finding the people that need it. I come back to the “Cult of Done Manifesto” often, and even have a copy of it hanging on my wall. [The Cult of Done: Break the starting cycle](https://youtu.be/bJQj1uKtnus?si=p9CJm3JQOxblWYrW)
