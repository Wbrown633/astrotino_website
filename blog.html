        <h3>Post about the cult of getting things done</h3>
        I make no promises about the output of this blog section. That being said, I thought it was appropriate to include a post about this video that actually got this website made. 
        I think it can serve as a good kickstart for anyone in a creativity or productivity rut. As with all advice, it can’t be applied to all situations directly, but I think it has a 
        way of finding the people that need it. I come back to the “Cult of Done Manifesto” often, and even have a copy of it hanging on my wall. 
        
        <h3>Post about making this website</h3>
        In honor of my first post about getting things done, I wanted to talk about the creation of this blog section. I almost cut it from the site a few times but if I’m totally honest 
        it felt a bit empty without it. However, the more I looked into setting up the blog section, the more I got a bit overwhelmed and felt like I was getting pulled away from the main 
        goal of the project. Get the website live. I felt myself being pulled down into rabbit holes of CMSes and static website generators and to be perfectly honest those are almost 
        certainly the correct way to make this website long term. But my goal was to be done more than to be correct. So I decided to stay the course with my extremely simple workflow of 
        only HTML and CSS, at least for now. But I wasn’t willing to give up editing the posts in markdown (surely due at least in part to the brainwashing the wonderful podcast Cortex 
        has done to me over the years) so I made a minor compromise and went looking for a tool to convert markdown to HTML. And quickly I found a nice little tool called pandoc. 
        With that in hand I set about making the absolute hack that is my “CMS”. Text goes in to a bash script on my computer and comes out as a wonderful new HTML file. HTML file gets 
        thrown into the /blog_posts folder in my website folder and I update a few links and boom I have a finished (aka done) blogpost. Maybe someday I’ll allow myself the freedom 
        to write what I’m sure is the 3-5 lines of javascript necessary to automate said links. But for now I’m happy. The website is up, and it’s doing its purpose. Maybe someday 
        I’ll get around to tearing it all down and doing it the “right” way, but for now it’s something glorious. It’s done. 
        
        <h3>Assorted Tips about OpenFOAM</h3>
        Getting started with OpenFOAM is quite the overwhelming experience. When I recently set out to do so I didn’t really have the first clue what I was doing. 
        But I had two advantages: I had experience with thermal simulation in Flotherm XT and I had experience coding. I’m sure smarter people than myself 
        could figure out OpenFOAM without either of those sources of experience, but I don’t think I could have.
